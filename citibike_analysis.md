### Written Analysis

For the analysis I chose to investigate how population of Des Moines and New York effect the number of people who may use a Bike Sharing Program in Des Moines.  My assumption is that the volume would be approximately 10% that of NYC’s program.  That is before further analysis listed in the footnote below.

After Deeper investigation I have chosen to focus on the borough of Queens as a better area to analyze.  Though the demographics and density of Queens is still much greater than Des Moines, it is closer in size over all of Manhattan or all of NYC.  In addition, Des Moines has a mass of the population separated by a body of water.  This is also true of Queens and Manhattan.

The basic summary is that though there are a large difference in the total population.  However, there are areas that lend itself in Des Moines for a bike share program.  


Story Page Summaries:
Census Data:
	This page shows a general overview of Des Moines, All of NYC and the specific borough I focused on of Queens.  This is not an exhaustive list of data – just a selection of key metrics for review with a comp between Queens and Des Moines.  The major trend to see here is that the population on New York is almost 10x that of Des Moines.  So that scale needs to be taken into account throughout the analysis.
Ride by Age:
	This is just a general breakdown of riders age and duration of ride for that of current NYC Bike Sharing data.  As there is minimal differences in demographics other than NYC skews a bit older, which only backs the idea of the Bike program being effective.  The age difference can be seen on page 1.
Queens Terrain:
Queens is a relatively flat area that is separated by a body of water to Manhattan.
Des Moines Terrain:
Des Moines, like Queens, is a relatively flat city that is separated by a body of water.  The major note is here is that it is flat which makes riding easier.
Des Moines 5 mile zoom:
The major takeaway here is that Des Moines has a dense metro area; however, after you leave the city the density dips until you get a few miles out of the city.  I believe that this would make it challenging to scale to a larger area effectively outside the city.
Queens Population:
This is a map of the granular density of population for reference. Choose to do this map separately from the starting location as I felt you could easily see the density.
Des Moines Population:
This is a map of the granular density of population for reference. Choose to do this map separately from the starting location as I felt you could easily see the density.
Top Starting Locations:
This is a map of the top starting locations for all of New York.  You can see its more popular in Manhattan than other boroughs; however, there is still a good amount of traffic in Queens.  In addition, there is a less granular overlay of population for reference.
Queens Top Starting Locations:
This is a map of the top starting locations for only queens.  You can see the key areas and how they correlate with the more densely populated areas.

Other Notes:
One note is that there is a small program already in place that should be more investigated.  That info can be found on the tourism website: https://www.catchdesmoines.com/listing/bcycle/5327/.  That analysis is not in scope for this summary.
